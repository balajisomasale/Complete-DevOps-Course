Why to use Docker ?


we use devops to solve the problem of "It does not work in my system". Dockerfile allows us to install "OS" in any machine along with required dependencies.

Docker vs Virtual Machines (VM):

Usually computer machine is designed like below:

Application Layer (Browser)
   |
Kernal Layer
   |
Hardware

Docker vs VM:

Docker only deals with Application layer where VM covers both Application and Kernal layer

what is Difference between Docker and VM ?

Docker is very light weight as it does not have kernal layer 
Docker Deployment is usually Very fast compared to VM deployment.
